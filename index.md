### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Lab 1, part 1, is one of my favorites. Since that was my first time writing a simple code using Github, it was interesting. Even though I had some problems pushing my code to Github, I did better for my other labs through this lab. 

* Lab 3
    Lab 3, part 1, was interesting to work on. In this lab, we used various calculation methods to calculate a pizza's price. Also, through this lab, I had an opportunity to learn about the Google C++ format style and practice the various calculation methods in C++.

* Lab 9
    Lab 9, part 2, was fun to work on. In this lab, we had an opportunity to learn about the fstream library, and it was interesting. Also, we used multiple if statements to finish the code, which was pretty tricky for me to push to GitHub without any errors.
